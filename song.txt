Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
The music loud and the women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
Well, now it's alright, that's okay
And you may look the other way
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive
Help me, woman
Well now, I get low and I get high
And if I can't get either, I really try
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes
I'm a dancing man and I just can't lose
